# Blog

My blog and personal website. Credit to @wangonya for the [theme](https://github.com/wangonya/the-plain-gatsby).

## TODO:

- Footer navigation doesn't go in order of oldest to newest
- Inline `a` elements in footnotes
- Add a better favicon
- Add an archive of interesting links for reference. Similar to stars on GH. For example: https://jorin.me/reads/programming/.
- Get a better setup for images. See:
